## Description:

**Liverpool Cafe**

A forum for all Liverpool and Non-Liverpool fans around the world.
The idea of this website is to bring together users that share a common interest on a particular player and leave comments on their weekly performance. Users can sign in, add their favorite players to their favorites, and check up on them instantly without having to search for particular players. We at Liverpool Cafe welcome all backgrounds, all fans, and most importantly, we welcome the trash talk! Bring the heat, and get ready to get served in the comments!

The name of this site comes from my favorite Premier League futbol team. Along with that, the cafe portion stems from me thinking that a user would be enjoying a nice hot cup of tea while trash talking others in the comments section, or leaving beautiful and heartwarming comments on their favorite players. Unfortunately, there is no tea purchasing on this website and may be implemented in the future.
